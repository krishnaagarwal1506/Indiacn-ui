# 🇮🇳 IndiaCN UI — Community Design System for India (Early Stage)

IndiaCN is an upcoming **open-source design system** created to help build better digital experiences for India — especially government and public-service applications. Based on [UX4G 2.0 theme](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1471833723727926454)

The project is currently in a **very early stage**, and we are starting with a strong foundation of:

- **Accessibility-first**
- **India-focused UX patterns**
- **Consistency across services**
- **Copy-pasteable React + Tailwind components** (ShadCN-style)

Our mission is to make public digital services **easy to use, trustworthy, and truly built for every Indian**.

> 📌 This project is **not affiliated with the Government of India** — it is a **community initiative inspired by UX4G design principles**.

## 🌟 Why IndiaCN?

Millions of citizens interact with digital government services every day.  
But UX quality still varies — inconsistent components, language issues, low accessibility…

IndiaCN aims to address this by providing:

- Standardized **UI components**
- Support for **multiple Indian languages**
- **Accessibility-friendly** interactions
- Faster and more consistent development experience

If a team wants to build a citizen-facing experience — IndiaCN should give them the **best building blocks** from day one.
